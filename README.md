# Implement a program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder

TODO 1: Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;

TODO 2: Synchronization should be performed periodically.

TODO 3: File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;

TODO 4: Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;

TODO 5: It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;

TODO 6: It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms. For example, there is no point in implementing yet another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library.
